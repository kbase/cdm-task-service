# Trying to find a simple way to handle this was surprisingly frustrating. I spent a half
# day or so looking at alternatives and the crane CLI seems like the least bad option. I tried
# a number of things, most of which I don't remember, including http requests (had to be tailored
# to each repository somewhat) and https://github.com/davedoesdev/dxf (couldn't get anonymous
# access to work). If there's a python library that can take crane's place that'd be great but
# I didn't find it.
